# Event Related Potentials

Responses to a sensory, cognitive, or motor event.

ERPs for EEG and ERFs for MEG.

# Auditory Evoked Potentials

Indicate specific cognitive or sensory processes.

|Anatomical|Latency (ms)||
|--|--|--|
|8th nerve , cochlea|< 5||
|brainstem|2 to 20||
|cortex early|10 to 100||
|cortex mid|50 to 300||
|cortex late|> 150||

middle latency response
10 to 50 ms
components Na,Pa,Nb
clicks , pure tones
early auditory cortex

long latency Potentials
50 to 600
P1,N1,P2
stg for N1 , atc for P2

mismatch negativity
response when new stimulus does not match previous stimulus
100 to 300
auditory cortex , prefrontal cortex

object related negativity
response to parsing multiple concurrent sounds
180 ms
auditory cortex , thalamocortical network

P300 , P3b
response to target detection
300 ms
affected by attention and task
parietal cortex , medial temporal lobe , prefrontal cortex

**Language Related**

left anterior negativity
word category violations
100 to 300 early effects
3 to 500 late effects
indicates difficulty with syntactic processing and working memory load

n400
semantic inappropriate words
400 ms
modality independent : evoked by spoken written signed words
maybe left STG , middle TG , left inferior frontal gyrus
perhaps indicates difficulty retrieving stored conceptual knowledge linked to a word , or integrates semantics into a conceptual concept

P600
syntactic ambiguity , less preferred syntactic continuity
600 ms
anterior superior temporal gyrus , left inferior frontal gyrus , anterior cingulate cortex

summary
mlr N1 indicate sound was received by the auditory system

p2,p3b,mmn,orn indicate discrimination of complex auditory stimuli

n400 p600 encompass multiple modalities beyond auditory and indicate high level language processing
