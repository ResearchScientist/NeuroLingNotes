# Phonology

**phonemes**

Basic units of sound (consonants , vowels)

**words**

words comprised of a representational form and its associated meaning

word
- form
 - sound
 - spelling
- meaning

**semantic network**

Association between related words.

**phonological network**

Neighbors differ from each other by one phoneme.

# Cohort Model

Model for auditory word recognition.
- activation
- competition
- selection

Words are activated as auditory input is received in real time. As signal continues words compete for activation. Best match to signal is selected.

# Non Native Phonology

**fuzzy representation**

When learners are unable to differentiate between L2 phonemes such as Japanese where /l/ & /r/ do not contrast they may retrieve the incorrect meaning.

# Morphology

**morpheme**

Smallest unit that has meaning.

- monomorphemic - consists of only the stem
- polymorphemic - consists of stem and other morphemes

**word structure**

- inflection
 - stem + affixes (lexeme forms)
- derivation
 - stem + affixes (new lexeme)
- compounding
 - two words (new lexeme)

# Lexical Decision Task

Test for morphological decomposition.

Stimuli consists of real and contrived words. Each presented one after the other. Task is to indicate if the word is real or not. Accuracy and reaction times are recorded.

Control for word length and frequency.
