**Lecture 1**

> development

- newborns prefer speech over other sounds
- newborns can discriminate between prosodically distant languages
- 4 months can discriminate between prosodically close languages
- nirs and eeg show left temporal activity to linguistic sounds
- newborns can discriminate word order changes
- newborns can recognize speech patterns

specialize into native language
- unable to discriminate non native vowels around 6 months
- unable to discriminate non native consonants around 12 months

critical periods
- 0 to 4 months , language discrimination
- 6 to 10 months , native phonetic categories
- 12 to 16 months , word forms
- 16 to 24 months , phonological categories

perception of continuous sound stream
- phonemes and syllables , well formed syllables are more sonorant at the onset and coda
- right front parietal region processes suprasegmental information such as speech and the syllable envelope
- transitional probability : likelihood that one syllable follows another
- identify wordforms if aligned with a prosodic edge
- easier to identify stress initial words

sensitive to rhythm in language perception such as prosodic contour
- duration , final prominence , iambic rhythm (weak onset)
  prominent element is longer in duration , seen in VO languages such as Italian English
- pitch , initial prominence , trochaic rhythm (strong onset)
  prominent element is higher in pitch , seen in OV languages such as Turkish Japanese

**Lecture 2**

> prosody

- oscillogram displays the continuous speech signal
- pauses in speech do not help identify word boundaries
- infants can segment speech at 7 months

behavioural
- central fixation paradigm
- head turn

- phonemes : which phonemes does the language have
- prosody : lexical stress , lexical tone , lexical pitch , phrasal stress
- phonotactic : which phonemes can combine and which cannot for the given language , 5 months
- lexical : which phonological form corresponds to which meaning

prosody is the melodic property of language such as rhythm, intonation, stress and acoustic cues such as pitch duration intensity

speech segmentation
english has a trochaic foot rhythm , infants learn to segment SW before learning WS bisyllables
french , learn to segment single syllables
japanese , learn to segment with mora units

comparative psycholinguistics : compares different languages
to find language specific and general overlap

vowel harmony : phonotactic constraint on the co-occurrence of vowels in syllables within a word or between words

english and french do not have vowel harmony

**Lecture 3**

> tones

more tonal languages than non tonal languages
tone is not the same as intonation

perception paradigms
- AXB identification , is given tone x closer to a or b
- AX discrimination , are a and x the same or different
- AXB discrimination , given x matches a or b can participant identify which one it matches
- odd ball
- frequency following response , brainstem analysis
- mismatch negativity , erp at 100 to 250 ms from onset of deviant sound in a pattern

**Lecture 4**

> developmental disorder dyslexia

transparent ortography vs opaque ortography

phonological awareness
ability to recognize identify manipulate phonological units withing words
- phonological memory: encoding sound information for short term storage
- phonological access to lexical storage: retrieval of phonological information from memory
- phonological sensitivity: oral language sound structure sensitivity , conscious manipulation of phonological units in words

epidemiology
- 10% population
- 50% within family

tests for phonological awareness
- elision , blending , sound matching , non word repitition , rapid object naming

phonological development
first - syllables, onset rime, nucleus coda, phoneme, phone - last

phonological awareness , reading ability , and speech perception are correlated

experimental design
- cross sectional , longitudinal

**Lecture 5**

> covert contrasts

A speaker makes 2 utterances and pronounces a distinction between them but the listener is unable to perceive the uttered phonological contrast.

*Speech Representation*

For phonological contrast a minimum pair of phonemes represent different meanings.
/c/at & /s/at

Although speech sound perception is perceptive to all possible sounds innately ,
speech sound production is acquired sequentially according to language. Across languages production of different sounds is acquired at different times. Which leads to a speaker being able to perceive phonological contrast but unable to produce phonological contrast until they have acquired production of both pairs.

t d k g n

Neutralisation
- stopping : /s/ produced as /t/
- palatalisation : /s/ produced as /S/
- velar fronting : /k/ produced as /t/

Contrasts
- overt contrast : speaker produces 2 distinct phonemes and they are perceived by a listener as distinct
- neutralisation : speaker attempts to produce 2 distinct phonemes but produces the same one and a listener perceives both as the same
- covert contrast : speaker attempts to produce 2 distinct phonemes but the produced phonemes difference is not perceived by a listener but is measurable with instrumentation

*Measures*

Various measures are defined per study so no clear agreement in specific measures between studies. Such as target age for acquisition, type and number of produced speech sounds to indicate acquisition, syllable positions.

Clinical assessments traditionally rely on listener impressionistic transcripts. Better to instead focus on speaker with instrumental measures such as acoustic and articulatory measures.

- acoustics : waveform , spectrogram
- articulatory : sonogram

*Studies*

Choose a contrast that
- speakers neutralize
- has specific acoustic properties

Stimuli
- target sound must appear in a similar phonological context across conditions , such as onset position , stressed vowel , and ending vowel , team tear teal
- consider word frequency

Procedures
- spontaneous production
- elicited utterances
- imitation or repetition

Obtain both impressionistic transcriptions and acoustic analysis. For impressionistic transcriptions consider if coding should be double blind (should transcriber know the target words).

Criteria
define inclusive and exclusive criteria for stimuli , participants , and analysis.

# Lexicon Stream

**Lecture 1**

> word learning

word learning involves
- mapping
- retention
- generalization

*mapping*
- encoding word
- encoding referent
- linking word and referent

fast mapping makes use of pre-existing knowledge to map an object to a word
given a list of objects where one is new and a new name is given
and asked to match the new name to one of the objects in the list
- mutual exclusivity : process of elimination , removes known objects and known names from list to arrive at object with no known match and matches new name to that object
- novelty : new word and new object are matched based on both being new
- pragmatics : drawing attention to named new object , such as with visual gaze
- physical space : object proximity to name
- visual field : holding object close to face

*retention*
- maintaining the link between word and referent

to help with retention use repetition and additional cues
[repeated exposure , multimodality]

*generalization*
- generalize the word
- generalize the referent
- generalize the link
- such as prototypes

by 2 years uses common shape to generalize objects

learning with a variety of similar shaped objects instead of identical objects leads to richer word vocabulary

**Lecture 2**

> lexical network

MODELS
- trace
- distributed cohort

words may be connected based on semantic and phonological dimensions

when presenting an object prior to presenting two objects
the onset of the lone objects name primes reaction to the two objects with longer fixation on the object with a similar onset

At 18 months phonological overlap effect increases recognition while at 24 months the overlap inhibits processing.

when presenting 2 known objects one after the other but prior to presenting the first object a word is spoken that is semantically related to the object is presented

At 18 months no difference in looking time when heard word is related or not related to the target word in the subsequent picture while at 21 months the semantic overlap shows improved processing of the target word in the subsequent picture.

As vocabulary increases inhibitory links between words also increases.

Early words contain frequent sound combinations.

Theories
- preferential attachment : words related to highly connected words easier to enter lexicon
- preferntial acquisition : words more connected in the real world learning environment easier to enter lexicon
- associates : novel words highlighted by relationship to known words

**Lecture 3**

> lexicon

- relies on meaning construction and categorization skills
- acquires noun first then verbs

**Lecture 4**

> language learning

- initially learnt words are contextually similar across languages
- nouns learnt first , then verbs and adjectives , then function words
- females produce more language than males

vocabulary size and sentence complexity are linearly corelated

- childes
- wordbank

**Lecture 5**

> multilingual learning

speech segmentation
- statistical properties such as high frequency consonant clusters that are common for words and low frequency clusters that can be considered word boundaries
- cues such as prosody , stress

von holzen mani singh
words from one language can activate words from other languages
strength of activation is modulated by language dominance

Storytelling and reading are more effective for vocabulary learning than songs.

Measures

- total vocabulary size per language
- total concept size for all languages

need to overcome potential issues with cognates and translations
while also controlling for numerous confounds such as age , gender

# Morphology Stream

**Lecture 1**

> grammar

Poverty of Stimulus claims that there is not enough information in raw speech for learners to formulate its complexity.

Generative Theories such as
- semantic bootstrap
- prosodic bootstrap
- principles and parameters
hold that syntactic categories and features are innate and apply to all languages
and a mapping of universal knowledge onto target language exists
they also hold that this is encoded in genes

Constructivist or Functionalist Theories such as
- semantic distributional analysis
- semantic assimilation
- usage based
hold that language is dynamically constructed from multimodal inputs , existing knowledge is reshaped as new input is received to improve its representative model of phonemes , concepts , labels , combinatory rules and more
these models are built using the same cognitive and processing mechanisms which are domain general
basic patterns are learnt first then abstracted onto more complex constructions

**Lecture 2**

> generative

learnt effortlessly and relatively quickly

**Lecture 3**

> functional

language is acquired through use
- general cognitive mechanisms
- learners induces language from inputs

- what are these mechanisms
- when does learning begin and end

**Lecture 4**

> bilingualism

Classification
- both caregivers same language
- one language per caregiver
- simultaneous : equal native exposure
- early sequential : one after the other prior to 2 years
- late sequential : one after the other after 2 years
- heritage speaker : one from caregivers , other from society
- L2 : second language learners

Measures
- experential : subjective , questionnaires , Q-Bex
- performance : objective , mean length of utterance # of morphemes , BESA

Morphology
- derivational : one word to another , to run becomes runner
- inflectional : word form is changed , she runs becomes he runs
