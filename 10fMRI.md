# MRI
tomography
high spatial resolution

Areas of increased oxygenated blood flow indicate increased neuronal activation as activated cells require more oxygen.

Measures BOLD signal.
- base line signal
- stimulus presentation
- slight dip in signal
- high signal overshoot
- level signal
- stimulus removed
- signal undershoot
- return to baseline signal

# Experiment

Series of scans and continuous tasks.

**Block Design**

Stimuli grouped into blocks.
- control 1 block
- task another block

**Event Related Design**

Stimuli presented separately in random order.

# Data Analysis

**logic of activation**

**multiple comparisons problem**

Repeated testing of same data set increases false positives due to setting significance level at 5%.

Make sure to use correction methods to minimize this issue.

# pharmaco FMRI

- Administer drug that blocks receptor.
- Compare treatment vs non treatment tasks.

Memantine blocks glutamate action on NMDA receptor sites.

**Cross Over Design**

Split into 2 equal groups.
- treatment + no treatment
- no treatment + treatment
