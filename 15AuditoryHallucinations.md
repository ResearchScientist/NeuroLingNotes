# Schizophrenia

80% of patients experience auditory hallucinations in the form of a human voice.

Even without a corresponding external source for the voice patients are convinced the voice is real.

30% of patients receive no benefit from antipsychotic medication.

# Dimensions

**Perceptual**

Perceived that the voice is speaking directly to the patient.

**Cognitive**

Voice comments on the patients actions and gives patient commands. The patient is unable to suppress the comments or commands.

**Emotional**

The sentiment of the voice as being either positive or negative.

For majority of patients the sentiment is negative. Voice wants bad things to happen to the patient.

# Perceptual Experience

Neurotypical speech perception is encoded in the left posterior temporal lobe.

Heschl's Gyrus

Primary Auditory Cortex

Planum Temporale

# Voice Model Theory

Auditory hallucinations arise when activation and inhibition processes are out of phase.

**Bottom Up Perceptual System**

Spontenous firing of neuronal cells lead to hyperactivity in the temporal lobe.

**Top Down Executive Control System**

Frontal area is hypo activated. Not activated enough to inhibit activity in the temporal lobe.

# tDCs

transcranial direct current stimulation

- neurons under anode (+) are excited
- neurons under cathode (-) are inhibited

# MR Spectroscopy

Neurochemistry

**Neurotransmitters**

Glutamate
- excitatory

GABA
- gamma-aminobutyric acid
- inhibitory

**Auditory Hallucination Event**

left superior temporal gyrus
- increased glutamate concentration

anterior cingulate cortex
- decreased glutamate concentration

# Dichotic Listening

2 stimuli are presented to patient simulataneously. Each ear receives a different stimuli.

- simulataneously present 2 different consonant vowel (CV) syllables
- one CV syllable per ear

**voiced**

/ba/ /da/ /ga/

VOT 20ms to 30ms

**voiceless**

/pa/ /ta/ /ka/

VOT 70ms to 80ms

Patients accuracy of right CV syllables decreased with severity of AH events.

Auditory signals are contralaterally processed. Since the left hemisphere has a preference for processing speech signals from the right ear, the decrease in accurately assessing CV syllables from the right ear implies auditory hallucinations inhibit the perception of real speech auditory input.

**Tests For**

- speech sound lateralization
- temporal lobe integrity
- processing speed
- executive function
- attention function
- impaired processing between clinical groups

**Top Down Modulation**

Alter instructions given to the patient.

- training effects
- attention focus
- working memory
- executive function

**Bottom Up Modulation**

Alter the stimuli or its presentation.

- voice onset time (VOT)
- inter aural intensity difference (db)
- stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA)
- languge differences

# Dichotomy

brain asymetry
hemispheric asymetry
lateralization
