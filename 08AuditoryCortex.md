# Location
superior and lateral aspects of the superior temporal gyrus

# Organization

- hierarchical
- serial processing
- parallel processing

# Onset Response Latencies

Period between beginning of auditory stimulus and beginning of the response to it.

ORLs to speech syllables increase along Heschel's Gyrus (HG) from posterior to anterior with shorter responses on lateral STG than anterolateral HG.

lateral STG engages as an early auditory processing stage

# Projections

From core auditory cortex in the posterior middle HG to superior temporal gyrus.

From non core auditory cortex in the lateral superior temporal gyrus to the inferior frontal gyrus.

# Spectral Organization

spatial organization based on frequency
- inner ear
- core auditory cortex
- lateral superior temporal gyrus

# Spectral Temporal Tuning

Recording spatial temporal patterns of gamma activity.

lateral STG display high activity as a response to hearing speech.
