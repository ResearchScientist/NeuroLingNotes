Aphasias are language disorders due to brain lesions.

A systematic language disorder affects any of the following
- phonological coding or decoding
- lexical access or retrieval
- syntactic processing or structuring
- discourse comprehension or production

**Etiology**

- trauma
- stroke
- tumor

# Non Fluent Aphasia

- impaired articulation
- fragmented speech , telegraphic
- agrammatism
- sound substitution

# Fluent Aphasia

- impaired speech understanding
- impaired semantic comprehension or real and contrived words

# Multilingual Aphasics

Speakers of multiple languages can present diverse outcomes post lesion.
- one language can be completely intact with no change
- another language can be complete gone as it never existed
- can read one but not speak it
- can speak one but not read it , unless it appears written in a particular style

# Assessment

- fluency
 - fluent or non fluent , ease of coherent speech production
- comprehension
 - intact or impaired
- repetition
 - intact or impaired , ability to repeat phrases


|Aphasia|F|C|R|Details|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Broca|-|+|-|telegraphic,infinitive forms,auxiliary parts of speech are ommited|
|Wernicke|+|-|-|neologisms,paraphasias|
|transcortical sensory|+|-|+|comprehension deficits|
|transcortical motor|-|+|+|production speech deficits|
|transcortical mixed|-|-|+|comprehension & production deficits|
|conduction|+|+|-|literal paraphasia , disrupted sound sequence in words , damage to arcuate fasciculus|
|anomic|+|+|+|impaired naming , impaired recall , attempt to describe object or concept|
|global|-|-|-||

`F = fluent , C = comprehension , R = repetition`

**literal paraphasia**

phonemically related substitution
- /b/ird with /p/ird

**verbal paraphasia**

phonetically related substitution
- /v/illage with /p/illage

semantically related substitution
- /cat/ with /dog/

correctly ids ball as red
the ball that the boy played with was red

difficulty ids cat as black
the cat that the dog chased was black

# Luria Assessment

|Aphasia|Lesion|Details|
|--|--|--|
|sensory||impaired phoneme recognition , impaired acoustic analysis , impaired speech sound production|
|acoustic||impaired auditory memory , impaired comprehension , impaired object naming , impaired repetition , verbal paraphasia|
|afferent||disrupted production , literal paraphasias|
|semantic|posterior|impaired temporal relations,prepositions,logical structure|
|efferent motor|broca area|words intact , disrupted sentence formation , disturbed kinetic rhythm , telegraphic|
|dynamic||sentences intact , disrupted cohesion of multiple sentences , strategy is to use cliches and canned responses or recite poetry to express oneself|
|amnestic|posterior|impaired object naming|

# Motor Aphasia

**efferent**
- signals from cns to sensory organs
- impaired articulation components

**afferent**

- signals from sensory organs to cns
- impaired articulatory apparatus posture

# Jakobson

2 main types of connections in language

**internal connections of similarity**

- capacity for selection

Impaired
- paraphasia
- picture object naming

Intact
- abstract words
- units such as articles, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions

**external connections of adjacence**

- capacity for combination

Impaired
- sentence production
- conjunctions are absent , telegraphic speech
- context

**Aphasias**

- coding - anterior aphasias
- decoding - posterior aphasias
