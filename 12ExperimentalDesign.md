**Question**

Are word forms stored or computed?

# Inflectional Morphology

**Dual System Theory**

- regular word forms follow a default rule to be generated
- irregular word forms are not generated but stored intact

**Single System Theory**

- all word forms formed by one system

# Behavioural

Add filler stimuli when existing stimuli is not enough to gain effective random order during presentation.

**2 factor model**

2 factors each having 2 levels

lexicality
- real word
- pseudo word

regularity
- regular word
- irregular word

# Functional Interactions

Psychophysiological Interactions (PPI)

In contrast to local activity which gives info about the current state but does not inform about the interactions between different brain regions , PPI assesses functional coupling between 2 brain regions.

PPI measures brain region interactions by estimating changes in neuronal activity.

- identify voxels of interest (VOI)
- define radius of VOI to perform PPI
- group level one sample t test

# Answer

For a morphology rich language such as Russian
- local activity suggests : 1 system theory is correct
- functional activity suggests : 2 system theory is correct

To test if irregularity , frequency , or productivity is the cause a new study was performed.
