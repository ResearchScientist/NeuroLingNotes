positron emission tomography

Detects local cerebral blood flow
via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>15</sub>.

When emitted positrons from isotope decay collide with electrons both are annihilated and emit gamma rays.

The detection of gamma ray bursts at exactly 180 deg from each other & arriving simultaneously at detector rings indicate their position in real space.

**Scan Duration**
60 to 90 seconds per scan

# Experiment

30 to 40 minute wait between scans
